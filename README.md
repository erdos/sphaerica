Sphaerica
=========

Interactive Spherical Geometry Software.

Since 2013, this project is no longer maintained. Thanks to everybody who got involved with this project over the years. I have truly enjoyed the time I have spent building this tool and I learned a lot during the process.

Feel free to fork the project or open an issue for questions.
